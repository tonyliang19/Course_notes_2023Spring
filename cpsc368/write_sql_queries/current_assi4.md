1. Find the Canadian authors who has never not had a bestseller (i.e., all their books are
best sellers).

    
        CREATE VIEW HadBestSeller(authorID) AS
        SELECT w.authorID
        FROM   Book b, Written w
        WHERE  b.bestSeller = 1  AND w.bid = b.isbn

        
        SELECT *
        FROM    Author a NATURAL JOIN HadBestSeller hbs
        WHERE   a.nationality = 'Canada'


2.  Which genre(s) are the most popular amongst the books that have been on a bestseller
list?
    
        SELECT      bt.genreName
        FROM        Book b BookType bt 
        WHERE       b.bestseller = 1
        GROUP BY    bt. genreName
        HAVING      Count(*) >=     ALL(SELECT Count(*)    
                                        FROM Book b2, BookType bt2
                                        WHERE b2.bestseller = 1
                                        GROUP BY bt2.genreName)



3. Find the first and last names of all authors who have written more than one book. Your
answer must use an aggregate operator.

        CREATE VIEW authorWrittenOne(id) AS
        SELECT  a.id
        FROM    Author a, Written w
        WHERE   a.id = w.authorID
        GROUP BY id
        HAVING COUNT(a.id) = 1
        
        SELECT  firstName, lastName
        FROM    Author a NATURAL INNER JOIN Written w
        WHERE   a.id NOT IN (SELECT * FROM authorWrittenOne)

4. Find the first and last names of all authors who have written more than one book. Your
answer must not use an aggregate operator.

        SELECT  firstName lastName
        FROM    Author a NATURAL INNER JOIN Written w
        WHERE   a.id NOT UNIQUE (   SELECT a.id FROM
                                    FROM written w2
                                    WHERE a.id = w2.authordID)


5. How many books has each province borrowed? 

        SELECT      COUNT(Distinct b.userID, b.bid), a.province
        FROM        Address a, Borrows b, User u
        WHERE       a.id = u.address() AND b.userID = u.id 
        GROUP BY    a.province

6. Each province/territory has run a campaign to encourage residents to use the library
more often. Find the provinces and/or territories that have had an increase in the
number of people who have borrowed a book in 2022 when compared to their average
across previous years

        CREATE VIEW countBefore2022(counts) AS
        SELECT      COUNT(DISCTINCT b.bid, b.userID)
        FROM        Borrows br, Book b, User u
        WHERE       b.borrowYear < 2022 AND br.bid = b.isbn AND
                    br.userID = u.id
        GROUP BY    b.borrowYear

        SELECT      province
        FROM        Address a NATURAL JOIN Borrows br NATURAL JOIN User u
        WHERE       borrowYear = 2022
        GROUP BY    a.province
        HAVING      COUNT( DISTINCT b.bid, b.userID) > AVG(SELECT * countBefore2022)


7. Find the most common genre for each author.

        CREATE VIEW countGenres(count) AS
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Author NATURAL JOIN Written NATURAL JOIN BookType
        GROUP BY genreName

        SELECT      a.id, bt.genreName
        FROM        Author a NATURAL JOIN BookType bt
        GROUP BY    a.id, bt.genreName
        HAVING      COUNT(*) > ALL (SELECT * FROM countGenres)




8. Letâ€™s assume that we have divided our library users into the following age groups: young
readers (ages 0 to 12), young adults (13 to 19), adults (19 to 55), and seniors (55+).
Find the books that have been read by every age group.

        CREATE VIEW notReadBooks(isbn, title) AS
        SELECT      b.isbn, DISTINCT b.title
        FROM        Book b, Borrows br, User u  
        WHERE       b.id = br.bid AND br.userID = u.id AND
        GROUP BY    b.isbn, b.title
        HAVING      COUNT(*) = 0

        SELECT  b.title
        FROM    Book b
        WHERE   b.isbn NOT IN (SELECT * FROM notREADBooks)

9. Find the number of brand new users for libraries in each province and territory for 2022.

        CREATE VIEW oldUsers(id) AS
        SELECT      u.id
        FROM        Address a, Borrows br, User u
        WHERE       a.id = u.id AND br.year < 2022 AND br.userID = u.id

        SELECT      COUNT(*)
        FROM        Address a, Borrows br, User u
        WHERE       a.id = u.id AND 
                    br.borrowYear = 2022 AND 
                    br.userID = u.id AND 
                    u.id NOT IN (oldUsers.id)
        GROUP BY    a.province


10. Find the most popular genre for each year.

        CREATE VIEW countGenres(count) AS
        SELECT      COUNT(*)
        FROM        BookType bt NATURAL JOIN Borrows br NATURAL JOIN User u
        GROUP BY    genreName

        SELECT      br.borrowYear, bt.genreName
        FROM        BookType bt NATURAL JOIN Borrows br NATURAL JOIN User u
        GROUP BY    br.borrowYear, bt.genreName
        HAVING      COUNT(*) >= ALL (SELECT * FROM countGenres)
